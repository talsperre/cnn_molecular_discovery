# cnn_molecular_discovery
An unsupervised CNN based architecture for molecular discovery.

In this work, we combine the approaches of two methods: [Atom2Vec](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/28/E6411) and [Atom Table CNNs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-019-0223-y) to get SOTA resuts in the Supercon dataset for critical temperature evaluation.

The network architecture is given below:
